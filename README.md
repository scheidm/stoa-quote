# stoa-quote
This project is an expermental attempt to provide quotations of Stoic philosophy in the greater context of their source
material. The initial goal is to be able to hot-link any highlighted passage and link back to an open-source translation
of the Stoic classics, starting with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Eventually I hope to include alternate translations,
cross-referencing against copy-righted translations, and the Greek original alongside.
